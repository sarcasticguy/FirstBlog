            <p>I believe that a good citizen doesn't use the technology for bad, but for good. I think that he/she uses it to not do wrong towards others. Also, with social change, a good citizen wouldn't use the social change to hurt people over the internet. I believe that good citizens don't take people for granted online towards people or in a group chat without that person. </p>
